# Project_Fashion_Classification
Applied and analysed different neural networks on Fashion-MNIST dataset which is a dataset of 60000 train and 10000 test images each consist of 28*28 grayscale images associated with a label from 10 classes. Applied 2 layer neural network, CNN with 1 convolution layer, CNN with 2 convolution layer, CNN with 4 convolution layer and VGG like model and found out that VGG like model fits best to the dataset but CNN with 4 convolution layer is more time efficient.
